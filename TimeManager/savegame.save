[x] How to get input type from mapping? -> Get input settings

[x] Map input actions and axis with textures for Keyboard and Gamepad



[] Make struct for combos
[] Enum for buttons you can use in Combos


[] Current Combo Array that will store list of actions names to an array (should probably be made into a enuM?)

[] Character combos, collection of combos

[] Make actor manager called ComboManager to handle current combo array

[] ComboManager eliminates possible combos while player inerts attacks
